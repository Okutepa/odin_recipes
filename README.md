# Recipe Website Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple recipe website I built for The Odin Project's HTML Foundations course. It has a main page, called index.html, that links to a few recipe pages. Each recipe page shows a dish with its ingredients and steps. I used only HTML to build it, focusing on creating the structure and content. It doesn't have styling yet (CSS will come later!), but it works as a basic website.

## Skills Demonstrated
By building this website, I learned and showed these HTML skills:

### HTML Document Structure
Set up a proper HTML page with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags to make sure the website works correctly.

### Semantic HTML
Used tags like <header>, <main>, and <section> to organize the content clearly, like putting labels on toy boxes so everyone knows what's inside.

### Content Elements
Added headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul> for ingredients, <ol> for steps), and images (<img>) to show recipe details.

### Navigation
Created links with <a> tags to connect the main page to each recipe page, so visitors can click and visit different recipes.

### File Organization
Kept all files (like index.html and recipe pages) in a project folder and made sure links and images point to the right places.

## Reflection
This project was like building a small cookbook shop from scratch. I practiced making pages that work together and learned how to structure HTML so it's easy to understand. It's a starting point, and I'll make it look prettier with CSS in the future!
